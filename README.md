 ### The Fladango Movie Ticket Web App ###

 The flatdango is a movie ticketing web application that allows its users to view on the latest movies that may be debuting on the screens of cinemas. The user gets a chance to buy the ticket online rather than go to get the ticket physically.

 ### How Flatdango operates###
 On the left, the web application displays a list of movies in a list.
 Elements of the list are clickable and if the user hovers over the list the cursor canges into a pointer.
 If any of the element is clicked, movie details are dispalyed on the left; this is inclusive of a gif,movie title, movies description, and number of tickets.
 Additionally, there is a button that allows the user to buy a ticket.
